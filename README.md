HOW TO OPEN:
In the solution folder, open index.html


HOW TO USE THE SITE:

There are two buttons. One shows availabilities either of a student or a course. The other generates a schedule for a class or a student.

Student can see his availabilities and his schedule for the week.
Professor can only see which students are taking his class and the hour of his classes.
Dean is the only one that can download a json file that contains both the schedule of both the classes and all the students.
